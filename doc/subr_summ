%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

AXISFIT(TIME0):
Power-law fit, for A and B, within an interval [TINIT,TEND].
This should follow a fit to the orbital data - semi-major axis.
-> None.
<- ENDSTP.

COMPOS:
Calculate composition mass fractions for given T and RHO.
-> SGTSL.
<- Main.

CONSTANTS:
In this subroutine we define the parameters of all different
species that the comet is comprised of.
-> None.
<- Main.

DIVIS(MODIV,I):
MODIV=0 : Add two adjacent shells and divide the new shell into 2
          (nr. of grid points remains unchanged).
MODIV=1 : Divide shell in to 2 (nr. of grid points increases by 1).
-> None.
<- ENDSTP, Main.

ECCENFIT(TIME0):
Power-law fit, for A and B, within an interval [TINIT,TEND].
This should follow fit to the orbital data - eccentricity.
-> None.
<- ENDSTP.

ENDSTP(IPRINT,INDRED,ITIMEA,ITIMER,NMERGE,NRED,
       NIT,MIT,DIST0):
Determines parameters for the next time step calculations.
-> SETDIST, PRINT, PROFILE, SURFL, DIVIS, SMERGE, GRIDEF, HYDRO, MODEL.
<- Main.

EOS(RO,PS,DPDRO):
Provides equation of state for the solid matrix.
-> None.
<- HYDRO.

FLUX:
Calculate heat fluxes and their derivatives as functions of the temperature.
-> THCOND, SURFL, DIVIS.
<- Main.

GRIDEF(DELTAV):
Move grid boundaries inward by DELTAV (provided the 5 innermost
shells are large enough). First, boundaries are advanced down to
the innermost shell; when it becomes too small - down to the second
shell, and so on, until the the fifth. Old shells are stored in
DVP(I).
-> None.
<- ENDSTP.

HYDRO(PS,RHO,DM,DV,IMAXP1,PI4,EPSX1):
Calculates hydrostatic structure by adjusting volumes (grid points).
-> EOS, SGTSL.
<- ENDSTP.

INPUT:
This subroutine initializes arrays and matrices, reads the data
file (comin) and builds an initial model if NMODEL is negative.
Otherwise - reads a model from the comodi file.
After the model is built - prints data to output files.
-> PRINT.
<- Main.

MFLUX:
Calculate mass fluxes (mass per unit time) - vapor and gas -
and their derivatives for given T, RHO and fixed mass fractions.
Take into account Knudsen and Reinolds flow, depending on the
interaction between the material and the pores.
-> None.
<- Main.

MODEL:
Write data into COMODO - model output file.
-> None.
<- ENDSTP, Main.

POR(ROA,ROC,RODUST,RHOICE,RHODUS,MMAX,ROSGI,RHOSOL):
Calculate value of porosity.
-> None.
<- DIVIS, SMERGE, GRIDEF, COMPOS, INPUT, ENDSTP.

PRINT:
Print out full data to COMOUT file.
-> STRESS, TSTRESS, TABLE, SURFL.
<- Main, ENDSTP, SURFL, INPUT.

PROFILE:
Prepare and print data to COMPROF - profile output file.
-> None.
<- ENDSTP.

RTBIS(x1,u,xi,usol,alfa,beta,eta,H,Tm,cw):
Perform root finding by the bisection method, to the function defined by
UFUNC.
-> None.
<- DIVIS, SMERGE, GRIDEF.

SETDIST(DISPLOT):
Fills the displot array. The array's values represent heliocentric
distance, where the first 100 range from aphelion to perihelion.
The next 100 values mirror the first 100 values.
-> None.
<- ENDSTP.

SGTSL(N,C,D,E,B,INFO):
Matrix inverse.
-> None.
<- Main, COMPOS, HYDRO.

SMERGE(I):
Merge two shells into one. We do it in case one shell is much
Thinner than the next one.
-> None.
<- ENDSTP.

SOURCE:
Calculate vapor and gas gains or losses, QV(I) and QG(I),
due to sublimation and crystallization, and energy gain, S(I),
due to crystallization and radioactive decay.
-> SUBLI.
<- Main.

STRESS(IP1,PI43,PS,RS,SRR,STT):
-> None.
<- PRINT.

SUBLI(AP,BP,TI,T0I,RO,QMAX,
     STOV,AIB,PI,PORI,QVI,DQV1I,
     DQV2I,DQVDTI):
